Trainify simplifies reinforcement learning by enabling users to create and train AI agents in 3D environments directly on the cloud. Leveraging cutting-edge 2D/3D computer vision and reinforcement learning tools, our platform bridges the gap between idea and execution, allowing you to generate complex environments with simple natural language prompts and image references.

## What it does

> Imagine Google Colab (cloud collaboration and computing) + Cursor (agentic editor) + Blender/Unity (3D modelling) but specialized in reinforcement learning.

1. **Creation Interface**: Users can describe their desired environment using natural language prompts with their uploaded reference images for a simplistic workflow.

2. **3D Visualization**: Segment objects of interest using the text prompt and turn images into 3D object representation where you can explore and modify in real time.

3. **Editing Mode**: Intuitive tools allow users to adjust object positions, properties, and relationships within the 3D space with our cloud-based collaborative editor.

4. **Training Mode**: Built-in reinforcement learning capabilities enable users to train AI agents to perform tasks within their custom environments.

5. **AI Assistant**: An integrated Gemini-powered chatbot provides context-aware assistance during every step of the process.
